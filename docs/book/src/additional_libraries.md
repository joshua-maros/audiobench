# Additional Libraries

Libraries are files that contain new modules and patches to be added to
Audiobench. To install one, simply place it in `Documents/Audiobench/`. You'll
notice that there is already a library called `User` in this folder which
contains all the custom patches you make. Check out the next chapter if you want
to experiment with making your own library.
