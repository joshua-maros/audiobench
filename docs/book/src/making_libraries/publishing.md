# Publishing Your Library

Audiobench lets you pack up your library as a single file to make it easier to
share with people. Simply zip up the contents of your library and rename the
created zip file to `whatever_name.ablib`. Make sure that you do not zip up the
library folder itself! If you immediately see the `library_info.yaml` file when
opening up the created zip file, you are good. If you see your library folder
instead, you need to try again.
