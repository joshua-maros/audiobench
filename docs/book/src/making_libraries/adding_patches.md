# Adding Patches

Adding patches is pretty simple. First, open the patch you would like to add in
Audiobench. Click the 'copy' button in the header to copy the patch as text.
Then, create a new text file called `[patch name].abpatch` anywhere in your
library's folder and paste in the copied text. Make sure it is not called
`[patch name].abpatch.txt`! Once the file is saved, closing and opening
Audiobench again will now display that patch in the patch list in the home tab.
